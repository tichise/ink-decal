ink-decal

ink-decal is a library for projecting Splatoon-like ink using Unity's Decal function.

## What is Decal?
[Decal Renderer Feature | Universal RP | 12.0.0](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.universal@12.0/manual/renderer-feature-decal.html)

With the Decal Renderer Feature, Unity can project specific Materials (decals) onto other objects in the Scene. The decals interact with the Sceneâ€™s lighting and wrap around Meshes.
